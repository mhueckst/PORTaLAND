# PORTaLAND
 2D platformer puzzle game inspired by Valve's Portal Series<br>
 written by: Max Huecksteadt, Tierney McBride, Russ Pedersen, Natasha Naylor

## Language
We selected python for its simple syntax and fast implementation, as well as 
to gain more practice in building larger python programs. <br>We are using python arcade and OpenGameArt. 

## Features
The player can run and jump around a single level, and aim and shoot portals with mouse clicks. 
There is a simple platformer challenge to overcome that requires the successful use of the portal mechanism. 
There is an instruction screen, a pause screen, and a finish screen upon successful completion. There isn't a way to 'lose' the game.
